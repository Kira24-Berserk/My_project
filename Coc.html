<p>Clash of Clans is a mobile strategy game developed and published by Finland-based Supercell. The game was released for iOS platforms in August 2012 and for Android in October 2013. The game features a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. The main goal of the game is to build your own village by using the resources gained from attacking other players through the game's fighting features. Players can join together to create clans, groups of up to fifty people who can then partake in clan wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other. The game is free-to-play.</p>
